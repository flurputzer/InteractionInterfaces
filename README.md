This was created for the Building Interaction Interfaces course at TU Wien.
If you just want to use the app the "InteractionInterfaces.app" is included in the repo. Just clone the Repo and run the .app. This is currently only compiled for MacOS since its supposed to control MacOS through gestures similar to the trackpad gestures.

# Intro
This programm uses a [modified](https://github.com/brannondorsey/wekimini) version of [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) in order to open wekinator with a preloaded project.
