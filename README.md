This was created for the Building Interaction Interfaces course at TU Wien.
If you just want to use the app the "InteractionInterfaces.app" is included in the repo. Just clone the Repo and run the .app. This is currently only compiled for MacOS since its supposed to control MacOS through gestures similar to the trackpad gestures.

# Intro
This programm uses a [modified](https://github.com/brannondorsey/wekimini) version of [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) in order to open wekinator with a preloaded project.

and **both** HandPose-OSC and HandPose-OSC_mini have to be active on all desktops (you have to have multiple desktops in order for this to show up):

## What it does
The app is pre configured and wekinator is pre trained on the gestures that are described in the gui.
Just press **start** and try the gestures in order to control MAcos through gesture activated shortcuts.
You can change the shortcuts through the dropdown menus in order to change what the egstures do, you can also control other applications like this.
You can also continue to train the gesture using wekinator, you can either use the wekinator gui or the provided gui to train the gestures.
Dont forget to click on **file** -> **save** in order to save your training.
